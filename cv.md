## About myself
I am 41 years old. I have a great desire to master front-end development, because this direction has a huge potential for development. At the moment I know HTML and CSS quite well. And with the help of RS-School, I hope to learn JavaScript skills.
My goal is to find a job and get a job as a front-end developer and develop more actively in this direction.

## My skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* GIT, Github
* Figma
* Perfect Pixel

## Code example:
this code calculates the area of a triangle
```
    let a;
    let b;
    let c;
    let p = (a + b + c) / 2;
    let s;

    if ((a + b) > c && (a + c) > b && (b + c) > a) {
        s = Math.sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c));
    } else {
        s = `calculation is not possible`
    }

    console.log(s);
```
